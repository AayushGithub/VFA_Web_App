**The project and technologies created would have multiple use-cases, including vision center monitoring and screening, and at-home monitoring.**

## Glaucoma monitoring in vision centers

#### **Setup**:

A 27-inch monitor placed on a desk at seated eye level. The patient will interact with the program through a single button clicker. Surrounding the patient will be dividers to prevent visual distractions, with the optional addition of a white noise machine to prevent auditory distraction. The field of vision will be limited by the dividers, to maximize the ability to focus.

#### **Administration**:

The test will be administered and controlled by onsite technician/counselor, with the input being taken through a wired clicker-based input for the user. The administrator would not be required to be with the patient during the test (only during setup).
   1. Trial lenses will be provided by vision center at each diopter in order to enable accurate testing

#### **Duration**:
**Pre-test/training**
    1. 30 sec (one eye)
**Test**
    1. 3-4 minutes per eye (max)
    2. Includes thresholding Test

#### **Output**:

Decibel charts, pattern standard deviation, mean deviation, reliability scores (false positive/false negative), additional reliability scores (incorporating time to response, consistency of time to response)

#### **Distraction prevention**:

Options include: 
    1. White noise machine, 
    2. curtain/divider, 
    3. headphones/earplugs


## At-home monitoring for existing glaucoma patients

#### **Setup**:

Administered on users desktop/laptop as software solution

#### **Administration**:

Doctor would prescribe the test and the doctor could decide if the user sees results
   1. User would provide their own glasses

#### **Duration**:
**Pre-test/training**
    1. 30 sec (one eye)
**Test**
    1. 3-4 minutes per eye (max)
    2. Monitoring w/ threshold

#### **Output**:

Pattern deviation, reliability scores, field loss progression (would require multiple data points)

##### Donâ€™t calibrate against Humphries; instead calibrate against itself
##### Should get 7-12 tests in first 1-2 years ($200 for 12 tests)
##### Value prop on evaluating entire base of data and getting better
##### If rate of worsening Is significant, then alerts the doctor


## Screening of patients in vision centers

#### **Setup**:

A 27-inch monitor placed on a desk at seated eye level. The patient will interact with the program through a single button clicker. Surrounding the patient will be dividers to prevent visual distractions, with the optional addition of a white noise machine to prevent auditory distraction. The field of vision will be limited by the dividers, to maximise the ability to focus.

#### **Administration**:

The test will be administered and controlled by onsite technician/counselor, with the input being taken through a wired clicker-based input for the user. The administrator would not be required to be with the patient during the test (only during setup).
   1. Trial lenses will be provided by vision center at each diopter in order to enable accurate testing

#### **Duration**:
**Pre-test/training**
    1. 30 sec (one eye)
**Test**
    1. 3-4 minutes per eye (max)
    2. Faster test, more frequent
    3. Thresholding or single threshold testing


#### **Output**:

Pattern deviation binary, reliability scores

#### **Distraction prevention**:

Options include: 
    1. White noise machine, 
    2. curtain/divider, 
    3. headphones/earplugs
