* #### False Positive, False Negative, Gaze/Distraction Estimated Rate (may not be important) gaze alone could be interesting; donâ€™t need fixation loss, gaze tracking could be interesting

* #### Perform up to a 28 degree field

* #### Rapid testing with customizable duration

* #### Variable Lengths / Testing strategies
    * #### Screening Mode with custom speeds ranging from 30s-4m
    * #### Monitoring mode with custom speeds ranging from 2m-6m
        * Variable targeting settings to change the density of stimuli in areas of concern

* #### Ability to output all results as a readable .CSV file

* #### K-NN algorithms for prediction of absolute blindspot probabilities and estimated sensitivity

* #### Multiple algorithms to optimize speed of test and boost precision

* #### [IN THE FUTURE] Decibel scale with numerical outputs (not needed at home)
    * ##### % change scale instead

* #### Mean Deviation, percentile of MD (and at each point)

* #### Reliability index, which will compare against database of test results to determine a reliability percentile

* #### Pretest practice allows for the patient to understand the test which will reduce wasted time if patient is unable to take the test or does not understand the test. (needs to help with illiteracy)

* #### Pre-test
    * ##### 15-30s
    * ##### One eye
    * ##### Determines if the patient able to understand the rules of the test
        * Output: Yes/No will the patient be able to take the test
