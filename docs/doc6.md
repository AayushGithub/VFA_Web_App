title: Implementation and Testing Approach
---

## Usability in the US
* ## Evaluate pre-test
* ## Evaluate distraction using different interventions: white noise machine, curtain/divider, headphones/earplugs
* ## Evaluate comfort compared to Humphrey VF
    * ### As it relates to overall test, use of the joystick/clicker, distance to the test, ability to stay in place
* ## Evaluate optimal duration of test: run for 5-6 mins (end at user discomfort/time limit) 
    * ### Determine at which point do false positive rates increase significantly?
    * ### How significantly does duration improve resolution? (via computer simulation)

## Usability study at Aravind
* ## 150 participants (ages 35-80)
* ## Is the test able to fit into the workflow of the vision centers?
    * ### Order of operations
    * ### Who is administering
    * ### Infrastructure/time required
        * #### Lenses, computer
        * #### Technical
* ## Is the test providing value to the doctors/patients?
    * ### Data output and utility to AECS
    * ### Secondary endpoint- are we identifying actual glaucoma cases?
    * ### Survey AECS for value of the test in screening vs monitoring
* ## How are patients reacting to the test?
    * ### Comfort, distraction, duration of use

## Efficacy study for the pre-test at Aravind
* ## Compare reliability with and without the pre-test (specifically looking at the reliability score) (50 participants in each arm)
* ## Was the outcome of the pre-test reflective of the outcome of the real test? (100 participants)
* ## Did pre-test reduce the likelihood of repeating the actual test?
* ## Did it increase comfort/willingness?

## Validation study for monitoring glaucoma progression at Aravind
* ## 100-150 patients
* ## Comparison against prior tests for already-diagnosed patients
* ## Evaluate consistency of the test
* ## Primary endpoints
    * ### Pattern deviation vs. our outputs
    * ### Decibel comparison point to point
    * ### MD comparison
